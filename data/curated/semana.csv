Ecopetrol,"The risk rating firm Moody's Investors Service announced this Wednesday -August 24- that it maintained the Baa3 senior unsecured ratings of Ecopetrol S.A. and that it lowered Ecopetrol's Benchmark Credit Assessment (BCA) to ba3 from ba1 due to the company's high refinancing risk. This, according to the report presented by this company, is the result of an aggressive financial policy, in a context of high global geopolitical risk and volatile commodity prices, as well as a weaker government policy framework. The outlook on the ratings remains negative. “The downgrade of Ecopetrol's Benchmark Credit Assessment (a measure of the company's intrinsic credit risk without supporting considerations) to ba3 from ba1 was primarily based on the long time the company had been has taken to refinance nearly $5.1 billion in debt maturing in September 2023″, indicated the rating agency. One point that draws attention in the reasons why this firm lowered the rating of state oil company is that some of these were based in the ideas with which the new government, of Gustavo Petro, arrives, especially with regard to the change of the productive model in the country to give greater force to the use of clean energies. “The downgrade of BCA also considered energy and environmental priorities from the new government, which may include changes such as restrictions on exploration and production based on hydraulic fracturing in Colombia; limitations on new concessions or permits for oil exploration; and new taxes on the oil and gas industry, according to the tax reform proposal,” he added. However, according to Moody's, Ecopetrol's Baa3 ratings continue to reflect the company's status as the leading oil and gas producer in Colombia, which represents more than 60% of the country's production and close to 100% of the supply of petroleum products, as well as its important power transmission business in Colombia and other countries. “Ecopetrol's refinancing risk is high but manageable . Strong oil and gas prices have helped Ecopetrol's cash generation in 2021-22. For 2023-2024, Moody's believes that, based on an estimated average Brent price of $68-58 dollars per barrel, the company's cash flow will decrease with respect to 2022 levels”, highlighted this risk agency. , despite the volatility of the prices of raw materials, this rating agency believes that the company will be able to meet its financial obligations in 2023 with the support of access to the global and Colombian capital markets, its committed bank credit line of $ 1.2 billion available through August 2023; and government support, bearing in mind that it is one of the State's largest assets. According to Moody's, Ecopetrol's rating outlook would stabilize if the company could refinance upcoming debt maturities in a timely manner. In turn, an upgrade of Ecopetrol's ba3 BCA or Baa3 rating is unlikely in the next 12 months given the rating's negative outlook. “However, if the company manages to strengthen its financial policies and, at the same time, demonstrate the ability to reduce financial leverage while increasing production and keeping the useful life of proven reserves stable, its rating could improve”, explained this firm. Finally, the risk rating firm warned that a downgrade in ratings could occur if Ecopetrol faces liquidity restrictions; if its reserve life decreases significantly on a sustained basis; or if the retained cash flow/net debt declines to around 20%.“Furthermore, because Ecopetrol's ratings benefit from implicit support from the Government of Colombia, a",False,False,True,False,False,False,False
Ecopetrol,"In the last few hours, a document sent by the Santander Alliance was made known, where the government of the department, the parliamentary caucus, mayors, deputies, union leaders, representatives of the private sector and university rectors, request President Gustavo Petro , a representation in the general direction of Cormagdalena and in the board of directors of Ecopetrol. This initiative is given as a result of the fact that in Santander the navigability along the Magdalena River would generate that the cargo transported would increase from 3 to 19 million tons a year, this as a product of the mobility of dry merchandise such as steel, corn, wheat and fertilizers, among others. “For Colombia and for Santander, the navigability along the Magdalena River is a historical debt that does not admit waiting. Hence, we celebrate the commitment to the recovery of the sustainable navigability of rivers, as the government program ""Colombia: world power of life"" mentions, the document outlines. These representatives argue in the text that this means of transport It is the cleanest with the environment, where the number of greenhouse gas emissions is reduced by more than 60% compared to land mode, generating a reduction of up to 40% in logistics costs, which allows solutions to be implemented for alleviate hunger in a situation of high inflation, particularly in food. For their part, they clarify that the most important thing is that this project will contribute significantly by giving opportunities to the Magdalena Medio region, which, as the Final Report of the Commission of Truth, has been the epicenter of the Colombian armed conflict. “This region needs real opportunities for development. The navigability of the river, particularly with the construction of the rigid works between Barrancabermeja and Pinillos, would make it possible to boost tourism, the construction of shipyards, the extraction of quarry material and intermodality with a view to industrialization with projects of great impact in sectors such as energy and agribusiness. The geographical location of Magdalena Medio makes it a propitious territory to connect Colombia with the world through the articulation of river, land and rail transport modes”, reads part of the letter. However, the Minister of Transport, Guillermo Reyes referred to this situation, emphasizing that the Cormagdalena headquarters was going to be moved to the Caribbean coast, but after these announcements, the Alliance for Santander responded: ""We firmly believe that the headquarters is where it should be: in Barrancabermeja, the heart of the Magdalena River. However, its general direction has been in charge during the last years of people from outside this region, who have not shown the appropriation and the sufficient commitment to recover and maintain the navigability of the Magdalena River”. Likewise, the document mentions the reasons why they ask that Santander be inside the board of directors of Ecopetrol, since they emphasize that oil was born in said territory and that therefore the energy transition must be born. is Ecopetrol, and which in turn has shown a great commitment to combining technology with sustainability.

Ecopetrol,"The Minister of Finance, José Antonio Ocampo, told SEMANA what the new tax reform will be in the country, in addition to the future of macroeconomic policy in Colombia during the government of Gustavo Petro on such controversial issues as fracking and Ecopetrol. On this issue, Ocampo said that at some point they will begin to change Ecopetrol's board of directors, but that they do not expect to make such a big change, since at the moment they only expect to ask two people to resign, one of them is Luigi Echeverri, a person very close to former president Iván Duque. The controversy came when he was asked about the future of Felipe Bayón, president of Ecopetrol, whom Ocampo considered ""a great technician"" and who has had very good results. “The first semester went very well, among other things, due to the good situation of international oil prices. For the Government it is a great benefit that the extraordinary profits of the first half of the year have been obtained.” But regarding the practice of fracking, that is precisely the great objection that the Minister of Finance has with the president of Ecopetrol. “Let's say, perhaps, that Dr. Bayón should not have come out to defend fracking, because we are against it. It is a government policy. Ecopetrol is going to have to get into the idea that there is not going to be fracking.” On the other hand, Ocampo said that the Petro government and he, at the head of the Ministry of Finance, want to protect Ecopetrol in every way possible so that don't waste money. “I'm taking care of Ecopetrol. It is our great company, the number one in Colombia. For the Government, Ecopetrol is one of the treasures that we have to keep and improve as much as possible. It is a treasure of Colombia”. Likewise, he said that there must be greater incentives in renewable energies for the future. “The company is already involved in alternative energies and green hydrogen, which do not generate climate change problems. That's a whole line. In addition, recent gas discoveries have been very positive because in Colombia we have a much greater gas deficit than oil,"" said Minister Ocampo.

Finish the fiscal adjustment that has been incomplete under the previous government, although it improved significantly this year, and, on the other hand, finance the programs of the new government. V.D.: You are a very serious man. That is why I want to ask you if it is true that the Duque Government left the pot scratched. J.O.: I would not use that term. The truth is that I don't like it. But let's say there was an incomplete fiscal adjustment. The deficit is 5.6%. In addition, we have a deficit in the Fuel Price Stabilization Fund that is 3% of GDP. The total deficit is very large, and the public debt, which has been falling, is still one of the highest in history. It is more than 60% of the GDP. V.D.: Is that high deficit due to inefficiency of the previous government or because of the economic crisis that the pandemic brought? J.O.: I would say that the number one cause was the pandemic. V.D.: Some are comparing the reform of the Petro Government with that of Carrasquilla. Is it a fable or a joke? J.O.: A total fable. V.D.: Aren't they comparable? J.O.: No. The focus of our reform is different. We are not making some of the mistakes that Minister Carrasquilla made and they were the ones that generated popular protest. V.D.: During the campaign it was said that the reform was going to raise 50 billion pesos, then it could be 75 and in the end it was 25. What happened? J.O.: Strictly, there are 25.

Ecopetrol,"In dialogue with SEMANA, the Minister of Finance, José Antonio Ocampo, spoke about several issues that concern the country about the future of President Gustavo Petro's macroeconomic agenda. Among the things that the official told was the future of the Ecopetrol board and its president, Felipe Bayón. Ocampo said that, although they are going to form a new board in Ecopetrol, the changes would not be so great, since until now there is only talk that they will ask for two resignations, one of them that of Luigi Echeverri, close to former president Iván Duque. On the side of Felipe Bayón, president of the company, he could have another destiny.

He assured that this will be done at the next meeting that they convene and that they hope to start with that request. When asked by the director of SEMANA about whether Luigi Echeverri, the president of the board, is one of the two in the crosshairs, Minister Ocampo he answered without hesitation. “That's one of the resignations we're going to ask for,"" he said. ""We're going to ask for them so that when we call the meeting, we have several board members that we can appoint. Suddenly we make a change of statutes, although it is not clear that we are going to do it, ""added the minister. What is not clear is how the president of the board of directors of Ecopetrol, Luigi Echeverri, and other of his will be asked to resign. members. This request is unprecedented and has legal loopholes, since the board is elected by the assembly. In the case of Echeverri, although he was nominated by the Duke Government, it was the Ecopetrol assembly that received the trusteeship that was the only one that, in principle, could revoke it, unless he wanted to withdraw of his own free will. The Minister of Finance could not then demand his resignation, especially when Echeverri is not an official and the board of the oil company is independent. What would proceed then is that the Petro Government request an extraordinary assembly or wait for the ordinary one in March and present a new one. ready to form the board of directors. The safest thing is that it would have to make a change of statutes. The most recent antecedent of what happens in Ecopetrol with the arrival of the new government is what happened in Medellín with the EPM board when Daniel Quintero assumed the mayor's office. The board resigned and literally dropped the order. Everything indicates that this will not happen at Ecopetrol, especially when the best financial results in history have just been achieved.

In front of the current president of the board, Luigi Echeverri, Ocampo confirmed: ""That is one of the resignations that we are going to ask for."" Now, as for the question if Felipe Bayón will be asked to resign, Ocampo he asserted “That is a topic of the board that we name. He is a great technician.” The official added: “Ecopetrol's technical team is very good. I'm not going to argue about that.""
